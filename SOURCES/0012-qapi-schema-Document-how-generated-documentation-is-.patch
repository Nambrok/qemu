Subject: [PATCH 12/12] qapi-schema: Document how generated documentation is
 ordered
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Documentation generated with qapi2texi.py is in source order, with
included sub-schemas inserted at the first include directive
(subsequent include directives have no effect).  To get a sane and
stable order, it's best to include each sub-schema just once, or
include it first in qapi-schema.json.  Document that.

While there, drop a few redundant comments.
